## Introduction
We begin with individual testing of physical elements such as distance sensors, servo motors, DC motors, and switches. This phase resulted in the creation of functional modules to control each component, thereby simplifying the main program.
Once the physical testing phase was completed, we proceeded to integrate this part with the programming element containing:
+ Distance module
+ Turning module
+ Acceleration module
+ Brake module

This model will undergo robust evolution once it includes...

As we delve into understanding the intricate workings of our vehicle's electromechanical systems, it is crucial to uncover the underlying code that governs these components. This exploration focuses on the sophisticated modules within our software architecture, their seamless integration with the vehicle's physical hardware, and the meticulous process of building, compiling, and uploading this code to the vehicle's controllers.
Throughout this session, we will navigate the intersection of software and hardware, revealing how each line of code translates into actions within the vehicle's mechanical and electrical framework. By exploring these connections, we aim to deepen our understanding of the synergistic relationship between programming and engineering, which enhances the performance and functionality of our automotive technologies
